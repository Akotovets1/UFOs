## Overview of Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to create a webpage with a dynamic table that shows the filtered results of the UFO sightings data. 

The table was created using JavaScript, HTML/CSS and Bootstrap. Data is stored in a JavaScript array. The webpage was built using JavaScript. The webpage was customized using Bootstrap.


## Results

First, the  webpage was created only provided users with a date filter:




Finally, additional filters for the table were created: city, state, country, and object shape.

Users are able to filter data, by inputting a criteria into one of the filter fields and press enter to initiate the filter.
To reset the filter criteria, click the UFO Sightings at the top left of the website.


## Summary of Analysis

One drawback of this webpage is that the webpage is not adapted for viewing on a mobile device. So the first recommendation would be to add formatting for mobile devices.

The second recommendation could be that users enter data into the table, increasing the database of UFO objects
